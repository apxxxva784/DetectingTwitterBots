#### Abstract
Whether it’s updating people on which line of the
metro is shut down or announcing new policies or political
campaigning or keeping up to date with people and other organisations,
Twitter has become a handy tool in today’s time. One of
the biggest threats for the users of this microblogging site is the
ever-increasing bot accounts. These bots spread misinformation,
spam timelines, misuse trending hashtags for advertisement. A
lot of research has been put into automatically detecting and
suspending these accounts. One of the significant tools used for
this is Machine Learning. In this project, we tested various
classification algorithms and analysed which of the models can
most accurately detect bot accounts using a publicly available,
manually annotated dataset. We applied models on this dataset
and compared their accuracy to find which model is most suited
for further development.
